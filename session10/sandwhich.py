'''
You're working at a deli, and need to count the layers of a sandwich to make sure you made the order correctly. Each layer is represented by a nested list. 
Given a list of lists sandwich where each list [] represents a sandwich layer, write a recursive function count_layers() that returns the total number of sandwich layers.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
